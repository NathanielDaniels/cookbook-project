S&P Recipe Box is a custom-built project I did for a local Instagram "foodtographer". The main idea was to store their favorite recipes all while showcasing their foodtography business. The about and contact sections were the main design trend to add a homely feel to their website. Currently building a database to store recipes dynamically.

- About section hanging carved sign.
- Cutting board contact form.
- Fork scroll-bar (my favorite part)
- Popup Modal on recipe click.
- Functioning print option for each recipe.
- Functional Carousel
- Fully Responsive.
